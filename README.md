# jasmine-only

This is an attempt to get [mocha-style exclusive tests](http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/#exclusive-tests) via `describe.only` and `it.only` working as a standalone plugin that can be included alongside [Jasmine](http://github.com/pivotal/jasmine).

Right now this is just a work in progress based on commits in: https://github.com/pivotal/jasmine/pull/309 and https://github.com/pivotal/jasmine/pull/353

Contributions welcome!
